# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## API Request Optimization for Monitor Legislativo v4

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: June 23, 2025  
**Author**: Senior Engineering Team  
**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Priority**: P1 - Critical Performance Issue  

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: The Monitor Legislativo v4 platform is generating excessive redundant API requests to the LexML Enhanced Research Engine, causing performance degradation, unnecessary backend load, and potential rate limiting issues. Console analysis reveals up to 20+ identical API calls triggered by rapid user interactions in the search interface.

**Business Impact**: This optimization will improve user experience, reduce backend costs, prevent rate limiting, and ensure sustainable platform performance within our $7-16/month budget constraints.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 Current Issue
The Dashboard component lacks debouncing mechanisms, causing every user interaction (typing, filter selection, checkbox clicks) to immediately trigger API requests to the LexML Enhanced Research Engine. This results in:

- **20+ redundant API calls** during normal user search interactions
- Potential rate limiting from backend services
- Degraded user experience with loading states
- Unnecessary network traffic and backend resource consumption
- Risk of exceeding Railway hosting budget limits

### 1.2 Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issue**: Dashboard.tsx directly calls `legislativeDataService.fetchDocuments()` in a `useEffect` that triggers on every `filters` change without debouncing.

**Contributing Factors**:
1. **No Request Debouncing**: EnhancedSearch component immediately updates filters on every keystroke
2. **Missing Request Cancellation**: Previous API requests are not aborted when new ones are initiated
3. **Unused Infrastructure**: Existing `useLexMLSearch` hook with proper debouncing is not utilized
4. **Immediate Filter Updates**: Every UI interaction triggers instant API calls

### 1.3 Evidence from Console Logs
```
ðŸ”¬ Connecting to LexML Enhanced Research Engine... (x20+)
âœ… Backend connectivity confirmed, proceeding with enhanced search... (x20+)
ðŸ”„ Enhanced API returned no results, falling back to embedded real data (x20+)
```

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Goals
- **Reduce API calls by 85%** through intelligent debouncing and request deduplication
- **Improve user experience** by eliminating unnecessary loading states
- **Maintain budget compliance** by reducing backend resource consumption
- **Prevent rate limiting** from external API services

### 2.2 Success Metrics
- **API Request Reduction**: From 20+ calls to 2-3 calls per search session
- **User Experience**: Eliminate loading flicker during typing
- **Performance**: Maintain <500ms response time for live searches
- **Resource Usage**: Reduce Railway backend requests by 85%
- **Error Rate**: Maintain 0% request failures due to rate limiting

### 2.3 Non-Goals
- Changing the existing search functionality or UI
- Modifying the LexML API integration logic
- Altering the fallback CSV data mechanism

---

## 3. Technical Analysis

### 3.1 Current Architecture Issues

```typescript
// PROBLEM: Dashboard.tsx (Lines 74-94)
useEffect(() => {
  const loadDocuments = async () => {
    // Immediate API call on every filter change
    await legislativeDataService.fetchDocuments(filters);
  };
  loadDocuments();
}, [filters]); // Triggers on every filter modification
```

```typescript
// PROBLEM: EnhancedSearch.tsx - Multiple immediate handlers
const handleSearchChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  // Immediate filter update on every keystroke
  onFiltersChange({ ...filters, searchTerm: e.target.value });
};
```

### 3.2 Existing Infrastructure (Unused)

**Available Solution**: `useLexMLSearch` hook at `/features/real-time-search/hooks/useLexMLSearch.ts`

**Features Already Implemented**:
- âœ… Configurable debounce delay (500ms default)
- âœ… Request cancellation with AbortController
- âœ… Proper cleanup mechanisms
- âœ… Loading state management
- âœ… Error handling

**Problem**: Dashboard component bypasses this infrastructure entirely.

---

## 4. Proposed Solution

### 4.1 Implementation Strategy

**Approach**: Minimal, contained changes following the Senior Engineer Task Execution Rule.

**Core Solution**: Integrate existing `useLexMLSearch` debouncing infrastructure into Dashboard component without breaking existing functionality.

### 4.2 Technical Implementation

#### Phase 1: Dashboard Integration (2 hours)
```typescript
// SOLUTION: Dashboard.tsx
import { useLexMLSearch } from '../features/real-time-search/hooks/useLexMLSearch';

// Replace direct API calls with debounced hook
const { 
  searchResults, 
  isLoading, 
  error 
} = useLexMLSearch(filters, {
  debounceMs: 500,
  enableAutoSearch: true
});
```

#### Phase 2: Request Deduplication (1 hour)
```typescript
// ENHANCEMENT: legislativeDataService.ts
class LegislativeDataService {
  private requestCache = new Map<string, Promise<any>>();
  
  async fetchDocuments(filters: SearchFilters): Promise<LegislativeDocument[]> {
    const cacheKey = JSON.stringify(filters);
    
    // Return existing request if identical
    if (this.requestCache.has(cacheKey)) {
      return this.requestCache.get(cacheKey);
    }
    
    // Create new request with cleanup
    const request = this._performSearch(filters);
    this.requestCache.set(cacheKey, request);
    
    // Auto-cleanup after completion
    request.finally(() => this.requestCache.delete(cacheKey));
    
    return request;
  }
}
```

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Filter Batching (1 hour)
```typescript
// ENHANCEMENT: EnhancedSearch.tsx
const [pendingFilters, setPendingFilters] = useState<SearchFilters>(filters);

// Batch rapid filter changes
const debouncedFilterUpdate = useMemo(
  () => debounce((newFilters: SearchFilters) => {
    onFiltersChange(newFilters);
  }, 300),
  [onFiltersChange]
);

const handleFilterChange = (updates: Partial<SearchFilters>) => {
  const newFilters = { ...pendingFilters, ...updates };
  setPendingFilters(newFilters);
  debouncedFilterUpdate(newFilters);
};
```
