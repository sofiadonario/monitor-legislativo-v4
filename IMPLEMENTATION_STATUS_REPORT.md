## ✅ PHASE 1 ACCOMPLISHMENTS

### **Critical Security Fixes (COMPLETED)**

#### 1. **XSS Vulnerability Eliminated** 
**File:** `src/components/Map.tsx`  
**Fix:** Added origin validation, message sanitization, and Brazilian state code validation
```typescript
// SECURITY: Validate origin to prevent XSS attacks
const allowedOrigins = [
  window.location.origin,
  'https://academic-transport-legislation.edu.br',
  'http://localhost:3000',
  'http://localhost:5173',
];
```

#### 2. **Vulnerable Dependencies Updated**
**File:** `package.json`  
**Fix:** Updated all packages to latest secure versions
- **Vite:** 4.3.0 → 6.3.5 (eliminates esbuild vulnerability)
- **React:** 18.2.0 → 18.3.1 (latest stable)
- **TypeScript:** 5.0.0 → 5.7.2 (latest features)
- **ESLint:** 8.42.0 → 9.15.0 (security patches)

#### 3. **Content Security Policy Implemented**
**File:** `index.html`  
**Fix:** Complete CSP with academic-focused permissions
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';
  connect-src 'self' https://dadosabertos.camara.leg.br https://legis.senado.leg.br;
  ...
">
```

#### 4. **Resource Integrity Verification**
**File:** `src/components/Map.tsx`  
**Fix:** Local asset preference with secure CDN fallback
- Created `/public/leaflet-icons/` directory for local assets
- Implemented integrity verification for external resources
- Added fallback mechanism for CDN failures
