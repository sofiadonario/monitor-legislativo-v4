- **Nivo** for advanced charts and analytics
- **Deck.gl** for large-scale geographic data
- **Mapbox GL JS** for high-quality mapping
- **D3.js** for custom visualizations
- **Three.js** for 3D visualizations

**Secondary Strategy: R Integration Enhancement**
- **Plotly** for interactive plots
- **Highcharter** for advanced charts
- **Ggiraph** for interactive ggplot2
- **Statistical analysis packages**
- **Publication-ready graphics**
