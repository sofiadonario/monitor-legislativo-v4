## Implementation Approach
Following the Senior Engineer Task Execution Rule:
1. Each task will be implemented with minimal, contained changes
2. Focus on simplicity and maintaining existing patterns
3. No mock data - all features work with real government APIs
4. Test with actual endpoints and CSV fallbacks

## Next Steps
1. Begin with enhanced React components task ✓
2. Review existing component structure ✓
3. Implement changes incrementally ✓
4. Test each feature thoroughly before moving to next task
