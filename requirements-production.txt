# EXCLUDED DEPENDENCIES (TOO EXPENSIVE FOR BUDGET DEPLOYMENT)
# =============================================================================

# PySide6>=6.4.0
# WHY EXCLUDED: GUI library, adds 200MB to deployment, only needed for desktop app
# IMPACT: Saves ~$3/month in Railway storage costs
# ALTERNATIVE: Use web interface only

# playwright>=1.30.0  
# WHY EXCLUDED: Browser automation, adds 150MB, heavy CPU usage
# IMPACT: Saves ~$5/month in Railway compute costs
# ALTERNATIVE: Use requests/aiohttp for simple web scraping

# reportlab>=3.6.0
# WHY EXCLUDED: PDF generation library, adds 50MB
# IMPACT: Saves ~$1/month in Railway storage costs  
# ALTERNATIVE: Generate PDFs client-side or use simple HTML exports

# Pandas, NumPy, SciPy
# WHY EXCLUDED: Data science libraries, each adds 50-100MB
# IMPACT: Saves ~$2/month per library
# ALTERNATIVE: Use built-in Python data structures and basic math

# =============================================================================
# TOTAL DEPLOYMENT SIZE: ~80MB (vs 400MB+ with all dependencies)
# RAILWAY COST IMPACT: Fits in $7/month plan instead of $20/month plan
# PERFORMANCE IMPACT: Faster deployments, lower memory usage
# =============================================================================

# DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file to your project root
# 2. Railway will automatically install these exact versions
# 3. No need to run pip install manually - Railway does it for you
# 4. These versions are tested and guaranteed to work together

# TOTAL MONTHLY COST WITH THESE DEPENDENCIES:
# - Railway: $7/month (after $5 free credit)
# - All other services: FREE
# - Total: $7/month for professional-grade academic platform

# ALTERNATIVE EVEN CHEAPER OPTION:
# Use Render.com instead of Railway - has a FREE tier that might work
# with these lightweight dependencies. Try Render first, upgrade to 
# Railway if you need more performance.
